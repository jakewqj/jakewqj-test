Terry 分享了目前在做的一个效果器的统计。Donner 失真类效果器在其产品矩阵的占比只有18%，而其他厂家的这个数字能去到 40-50%。相比之下，Donner 效果器产品矩阵目前并不齐整，特别是受众最广的失真类效果器（Distortion，Overdrive ，Fuzz），目前能提供给终端消费者的只有三款。<p>
个人认为Donner 的品牌发展还是要守住自己的基本盘，特别是本身作为已效果器立本的Donner，更应如此。除了吉他，效果器是影响一位吉他手表达自己音色和风格最直接的设备，是直接为音乐本身服务的乐器。<p>
同样的元器件，由不同厂家组装是否会有不一样的效果？例如EHX 的会从中国以及其国家进口原件，然后在美国组装。我想说的是同一套元件由不同厂家组装的差异会是什么？Terry 答：音色上的差异不会太大，但是在电路的焊接、走线和产品质量控制上可能会有差异，例如是否会尖端放电、电路的噪音等等。<p>

最近有哪些效果器对于你们来说是比较创新的？<p>
> Terry：JHS Bonchai <p>
> Tim: JHS Bonchai 确实很不错。<p>
> Wahming：Side chain compression 的压缩效果器...<p>

Terry shared statistics on an effects pedal they are currently working on. Donner's distortion effects pedals account for only 18% of their product lineup, while other manufacturers have this number ranging from 40% to 50%. In comparison, Donner's effects pedal product lineup is currently not extensive, especially in the most popular distortion effects pedals (Distortion, Overdrive, Fuzz), where they only offer three options to end consumers.

Personally, I believe Donner's brand development should focus on their core strengths, especially considering that Donner is already established in the effects pedal market. Besides the guitar itself, effects pedals are the most direct devices that impact a guitarist's tone and style, serving as instruments that directly serve the music itself.

Would there be any differences in using the same components assembled by different manufacturers? For example, [Electro-Harmonix](https://www.ehx.com/) imports components from China and other countries, then assembles them in the United States. I'm wondering what the differences would be when the same set of components is assembled by different manufacturers. Terry responded: The differences in tone would not be significant, but there may be variances in circuit soldering, wiring, and product quality control, such as whether there are sharp discharges or circuit noise.

Which effects pedals do you consider innovative recently?
Terry: JHS Bonchai.
Tim: JHS Bonchai is indeed impressive.
Wahming: Side chain compressior pedal...
