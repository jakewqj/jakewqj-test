Today, one day before my 35th birthday, I've decided to move my blog from Wordpress to GitHub Page. Even though I don't post alot in recent 2 years but I do consider it's really cool building this blog with [Jekyll and GitHub Pages](https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages), as well as writing blog post with Markdown. 

## New Blogging Experience

I have sucessfully developed an increasing interest in building websites with fast speed and great performance during my entrepreneurship of e-commerce for the last 3 year. The business did not end well despite I built 3 Shopify sites and I've found some fun messing around with the [Liquid](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/) files. 

WordPress is great. I have used it for 5 years to store my writings and input from my magazine time, and to serve the personal diaries I have written so far. But I felt I wasn't really using many of its features and I wanted to use a Markdown to compose and store my posts - I just feel cool doing it! 

Before WordPress, I'd been through Sina Blogs, Blogbus and Qzone since high school. It was always fun time and I missed it when I had more desire to express. This is important, I mean ```the desire to express```, ```表达的欲望```.

I set up this blog to Jekyll and GitHub Pages, and the process has turned out to be easy enough for me without being a professional frontend tech guy. Thanks to Google, GitHub and [Cotes Chung](https://github.com/cotes2020/)'s amazing [Chirpy](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy) theme, I did not have to build it from scratch, while it still took me a week to test out what was the ultimate solution for my new blog. 

I have wanted to give [Hexo](https://hexo.io) a try, after several days' testing and having found [Chirpy](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy), I decided go with Jekyll finally. 


## Main purpose of my blog
 
1. Documentation for my writings, field recordings, and thoughts
2. Presentation for my expertise in Music Industry
3. Promotion for the indie music I love in China

For the next couple months I will just keep blogging for the pure fun of writing in [`Markdown`](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/). 

## Open Sources I am using
- Jekyll
- Chirpy Jekll Theme
- [jsDelivr Open Source CDN](https://www.jsdelivr.com/)
